<h1>MetroQuest by "VIVEK NAIR"</h1>
<h2>Delhi Metro Companion</h2><br>
MetroQuest is a program developed in C++ that helps a person to find a route to the destination entered. The program simulates a metro system with functionalities such as adding stations, establishing connections, finding the shortest path, removing stations, checking station existence, counting stations, and calculating fare and time. The main function initializes a Delhi Metro network and provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction. It also finds the total fare, time taken and number of stations in the journey. It uses concepts of OOPs, STL, and Data File Handling for its implementation.<br>

<h2>FEATURES:</h2>
<li><b>User Interface:</b> -Input: The program prompts users to input the starting and destination stations. -Output: Displays the route, total fare, average travel
time, and the number of stations involved in the journey.</li>
<li><b>Route Calculation:</b>- Algorithm: Implements an algorithm to determine the most efficient route between the entered stations, considering multiple line changes and minimizing travel time. - Data Handling: Utilizes data structures (e.g., graphs, adjacency lists) to represent station connections, lines, and distances.</li>
<li><b>Fare Calculation:</b> - Fare Structure: Implements fare calculation based on the number of stations traveled and any line changes required. - Display: Shows the total fare for the journey.</li>
<li><b>Time Taken Calculation:</b> - Time Estimation: Estimates the travel time taken based on the chosen route, considering line transfers and distances between stations. - Display: Presents the travel time taken for the journey.</li>
<li><b>Station Information:</b>- Station Existence Check: Users can check if a station exists in the metro system. - Count Stations: Users can count the total number of stations in the metro system. </li>
<li><b> User Experience Enhancement:</b> - User Guidance: Provides clear instructions and guidance for users to navigate the program easily. - Interactive Interface: Designs an intuitive interface to display route information, fare details, and travel time.</li>
